## üöÄ Project Overview

This chatbot system helps students of **AIET** and **Alva's MBA College** get instant responses to their queries using:

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - Hybrid Voting Classifier (for improved accuracy and robustness)

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  
  - Text cleaning and normalization  
  - Lowercasing  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Stemming  

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**:  
  Used for transforming text into numerical vectors for classification and similarity matching.

- **Semantic Search** using **Sentence Transformers (MiniLM)**:  
  Retrieves answers based on semantic similarity, enabling smarter and more human-like understanding of queries.

- **Google Gemini (Generative AI)**:  
  Summarizes lengthy responses into concise answers for better user experience.

- **Streamlit**:  
  Used for building the interactive web-based UI.
